For some reasono when linking with dune although
fork seems to work the processes are getting killed
with signal 11.
Solve that out.

Check out the fork code in examples

#define __NR_wait4              61
So at first it receives a wait syscall invoked by our
wait call for the child process inside the executable.

SIGSEGV	    11	     Core    Invalid memory reference
After the wait syscall the child process is killed by
signal 11


[SOLVED] The catch was I should dune_enter() right before
fork() plus I should also link the new executable to my
static library in order for the to recognize the symbols
